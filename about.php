            <h4>Hello World, I'm Sara.</h4>
            <p><img src="/Images/CFA_headshot-min.jpg" alt="About Me Photo">I am a music technologist, machine learning engineer and musician working to pioneer new ways of creating and 
            performing music with AI. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer and Artist in Residence at Suno, building accessible AI music tools while exploring their creative potential 
            through my own compositions. I make electronic music with my guitar and laptop, blending Tidal Cycles live coding with electric guitar looping to create a unique mix of 
            glitchy ambient techno sounds with classically-inspired melodies. I was a finalist in the 2024 AI Song Contest for my piece "Echoes of the Synthetic Forest," and 
            regularly perform around New England and abroad. <p>
            <p> I received my Masters of Science in Sound and Music Computing at Queen Mary University of London, where I was funded through a US-UK Fulbright grant to pursue music AI 
            research in the UK. My master's thesis focused on developing a steerable Transformer-XL model capable of generating loopable musical phrases for use in performances. It was 
            published at EvoMUSART 2023 where it received the Outstanding Student Award. I continue to incorporate generative AI into my performance practice, focusing on human-AI improvisation. I 
            have given talks on music AI to audiences of both musicians and researchers at The Rundown, Music Hackspace, ISMIR, Hackaday Superconference and XFest.</p>
            <p>Prior to my time in London, I spent three years in Boston working as a machine learning engineer at Bose and performing as a freelance classical guitarist for weddings and other events. While 
            at Bose, I worked in the applied research group in the Health division, developing prototypes that resulted in two published patents and two pending. I worked on deep learning models for speech 
            enhancement, writing custom kernels to optimize quantized models to run live on a hearing aid micro-controller. I also led a research project developing generative audio algorithms that adapt to 
            biofeedback signals to induce sleep using soothing music. </p>
            <p>I hold an interdisciplinary bachelor's degree in Music Technology and Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. While in Pittsburgh, I performed as a guitarist with chamber group pairings 
            ranging from renaissance vocalists, to string quartets, to banjo players. My senior capstone project, “Creating with the Machine,” was a set of compositions combining algorithmic and traditional 
            methods of composition into live performances to explore how interactive generative algorithms can influence creativity in musical improvisation. “Creating with the Machine” was premiered by the 
            Carnegie Mellon Exploded Ensemble, and was awarded the Henry Armero Memorial Award for Inclusive Creativity. I also presented the project at the  Hackaday Superconference in LA.</p>
            <p>I pride myself on having performed not only in concert halls, but also in an underground limestone mine and a giant inflatable dream temple. As guitarist, violist and composer for the Exploded 
            Ensemble in Pittsburgh, I collaborated with other artists and musicians to put on a literal underground electronic music festival at Bradys Bend Limestone Mine. We also performed an 8 hour overnight 
            concert of ambient music, where audience members were invited to drift in and out of sleep in an artist-created inflatable environment to experience the subconscious effects of the music. Needless to 
            say, I embrace abnormal and experimental performances. I'm inspired by musical ideas that are new, different and weird, and am dedicated to making these types of performances accessible and enjoyable 
            for all audiences.</p>
