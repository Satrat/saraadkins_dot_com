              <h4>Hello World, I'm Sara.</h4>
	      <p><img src="Images/CFA_headshot.jpg" alt="About Me Photo">Sara Adkins is a music technologist, classical guitarist and software developer residing in Boston, MA. By day she is a software engineer at Bose Corporation, and by night she freelances as a classical guitarist and makes weird sounds with her laptop. Sara is passionate about innovating new ways that technology can be used to enhance musical performances and art installations, and developing new tools for musicians to expand the creative possibilities of music and art in the modern world.</p>
<p>Sara recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA with an interdisciplinary degree in music technology and computer science, and a minor in sound design. While in Pittsburgh, she studied classical guitar with professor James Ferla. Sara was featured as a concerto soloist with the CMU Classical Guitar Ensemble and performed with chamber group pairings ranging from renaissance vocalists, to string quartets, to banjo players. Sara’s senior capstone project, “Creating with the Machine,” was a set of compositions combining algorithmic and traditional methods of composition into live performances to explore how interactive generative algorithms can influence creativity in musical improvisation. “Creating with the Machine” was premiered by the Carnegie Mellon Exploded Ensemble in the spring of 2018, and was award the Henry Armero Memorial Award at CMU's undergraduate research symposium.</p> 
<p>Sara prides herself on having performed not only in concert halls, but also in an underground limestone mine and a giant inflatable dream temple. As guitarist, violist and composer for the Carnegie Mellon Exploded Ensemble, she collaborated with other artists and musicians to put on a literal underground electronic music festival at Brady’s Bend Limestone Mine. The ensemble also performed an 8 hour overnight concert of ambient music, where audience members were invited to drift in and out of sleep in an artist created inflatable environment to experience the subconscious effects of the music. Needless to say, Sara embraces abnormal and experimental performances. She is inspired by musical ideas that are new, different and weird, and is dedicated to making these types of performances accessible and enjoyable for all audiences.</p> 
<p>In addition to her musical and technological endeavors, Sara also enjoys knitting, playing Dungeons and Dragons and thrift shopping. Her favorite TV show is Game of Thrones, her favorite podcast is The Adventure Zone, her favorite band is Glass Animals, and her favorite classical guitarist is Ana Vidovic.</p>
